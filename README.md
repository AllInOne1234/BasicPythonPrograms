# BasicPythonPrograms
Important- Requires Python terminal to work.

Contains a minesweeper game, a tictactoe game, an arithmetic 2-number calculator. Also has a "something.py" file for new users to start programming.

Allowed to share, edit, and anything else with your name on it. This is not a serious project, so I don't mind it.
